## SEB - STRING SLICING

### AIM  
To write a Python function that splits an email ID string into two parts using the "@" symbol.

### ALGORITHM

1. Start the program.
2. Define a function named splitstring that accepts one argument a.
3. Inside the function, use the built-in split('@') method to split the string at the "@" symbol.
4. Store the result in a variable x.
5. Print the resulting list x.
6. Call the function with a test email ID.
7. End the program.

### PROGRAM

```
def splitstring(a):
    x=a.split('@')
    print(x)

```

### RESULT
