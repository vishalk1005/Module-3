## STRING - FIND AND REPLACE

### AIM  
To write a Python function to accept a string, identify a word to be replaced, and replace it with a new word provided by the user.

### ALGORITHM

1. Start the program.
2. Read a string input from the user using input().
3. Define a function named joinstring(s) that performs the following:
  Use the built-in join() method to insert the - symbol between each character of the string.
  Store the result in a variable.
  Print the final joined string.
4. Call the joinstring() function with the user input as an argument.
5. End the program.

### PROGRAM

```
def joinstring(s):
    s1='-'.join(s)
    print(s1)

```

### RESULT
Thus the program that defines a function to accept a string and join its characters using the hyphen (-) symbol has been implemented and executed successfully.
